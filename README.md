# ScribbleCanvas
A group assignment with Socket.io

The live, updated branch. See https://p1xelpainter.herokuapp.com/ for a demo.

# Description

It's a group painting app and a game in one. The user can choose whether they want to draw or to play a game after entering their name. Saved pictures can, in draw mode, be saved and fetched from the database, though currently only one at a time. In game mode, users have to paint over the shown image.

# How to run

Can be ran locally by changing all URLs within to an appropriate locally hosted server.

Required Node, Express, and dependencies. **NPM install** should take care of that. Run as you would any Express app.

# Known issues

Only one image can be saved at the moment, and four players are required to start the game. The latter can be bypassed by opening four windows.
